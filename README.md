Video Processing Language for the Raspberry Pi
==============================================

My final year project for my CS undergrad at Cambridge. The project spanned
seven months and was assessed by a written dissertation.

I used the video processing power of the Raspberry Pi to create an educational
visual video processing language for children to explore video processing
and computational thinking on the Raspberry Pi.
